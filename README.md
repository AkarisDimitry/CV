# Minimal-CV
Minimal template for typesetting a curriculum vitae (CV) in LaTeX.

Hosted on https://github.com/FMatti/Minimal-CV

## Introduction
Motivated by a friend's request I make the source for the CV that has assisted me more (or less) on my journey in the last few years. I was inspired by recent trends of modularizing and condensing CVs onto a single A4 page. My aim was to keep the code as simple as possible and only as customizable as necessary, hence why I call it 'Minimal'.

## Features
Some of the main features that characterize this template are the
- coherent and consistent design language
- programmatically generated vector icons and flags
- tunable color scheme
- extendability for personal use

### Icons
I designed a set of vector illustrations that can be used as icons to guide the eye of the reader towards the relevant information.

### Flags
A small set of flags can be used to make your language competences visible at a glance.

### Color schemes
Custom color schemes can be quite easily added to the default design to personalize the CV.

## Closing words

The template is dedicated (in honor and mockery) to the one and only Carl Friedrich Gauss whose work and mentality has never failed to inspire me on my academic journey throughout the last couple of years.

Suggestions for expanding the set of icons and flags are always welcome. Make sure to let me know if this template helped you land a job.
